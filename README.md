Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Ethereum 1.0 is famous for it's composability that relies on synchronous calls, and it would be desirable to have such synchronous calls in a sharded environment. We designed a message format and data structures that allow shard chains to detect deadlocks and make progress without relying on any centralized chain, such as the beacon chain in the current Ethereum Serenity design. The hack provides a prototype implementation of the aforementioned message format and data structures, as well as a simulation and visualization for a few scenarios.
